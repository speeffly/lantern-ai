# Lantern AI - Mentor Guide

## 🎯 Overview for Mentors

This guide helps you understand the project architecture and guide your 4 high school students through the Presidential Innovation Challenge.

---

## 📊 Project Architecture (High Level)

### The Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (React framework) + TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- **Data**: JSON files (MVP), ready for database migration
- **Auth**: JWT tokens + bcrypt password hashing

### How It Works
```
User Browser (Frontend)
    ↓ HTTP Requests
Backend API Server
    ↓ Processes Data
JSON Files (careers, questions)
    ↓ Returns Results
Backend API Server
    ↓ HTTP Response
User Browser (Frontend)
```

## 🏗️ System Components

### 1. Session Management
**Purpose**: Track anonymous users before they create accounts

**Flow**:
1. User visits homepage → Frontend creates session ID
2. Session ID stored in localStorage
3. All quiz answers linked to session ID
4. When user creates account → session data linked to user

**Files**:
- `backend/src/services/sessionService.ts`
- `backend/src/routes/sessions.ts`

### 2. Assessment System
**Purpose**: Quiz that matches students to careers

**Flow**:
1. User answers 12 questions
2. Each answer has a weight (1-5)
3. Answers mapped to career sectors (healthcare/infrastructure)
4. Scoring algorithm calculates best matches
5. Returns top 5 careers with match percentages

**Files**:
- `backend/src/data/questions.json` (quiz questions)
- `backend/src/services/assessmentService.ts` (scoring logic)
- `frontend/app/assessment/page.tsx` (quiz UI)

**Algorithm**:
```typescript
// Simplified scoring
for each career:
  score = 0
  for each answer:
    if answer.sector matches career.sector:
      score += answer.weight
  matchPercentage = (score / maxPossibleScore) * 100
```

### 3. Career Matching
**Purpose**: Recommend careers based on quiz results

**Flow**:
1. Get user's quiz answers
2. Calculate match scores for all careers
3. Filter by sector preferences
4. Sort by match percentage
5. Return top 5 with reasoning

**Files**:
- `backend/src/data/careers.json` (career database)
- `backend/src/services/careerService.ts`
- `frontend/app/results/page.tsx`

### 4. Authentication
**Purpose**: Let students create accounts and save progress

**Flow**:
1. User registers → password hashed with bcrypt
2. JWT token generated (expires in 7 days)
3. Token stored in localStorage
4. Token sent with each API request
5. Backend verifies token for protected routes

**Files**:
- `backend/src/services/authService.ts`
- `backend/src/routes/auth.ts`
- `frontend/app/login/page.tsx`
- `frontend/app/register/page.tsx`

**Security**:
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (10 salt rounds)
- JWT tokens signed with secret key
- Token verification on protected routes
- Input validation on all forms

### 5. Action Plans
**Purpose**: Give students step-by-step career guidance

**Flow**:
1. User selects a career
2. System generates personalized action plan
3. Steps categorized (education, skills, experience, etc.)
4. Steps prioritized (high, medium, low)
5. User can check off completed steps

**Files**:
- `backend/src/services/actionPlanService.ts`
- `frontend/app/action-plan/[careerCode]/page.tsx`

## 🛠️ Technical Concepts to Teach

### 1. Frontend vs Backend
**Analogy**: Restaurant
- Frontend = Dining room (what customers see)
- Backend = Kitchen (where food is prepared)
- API = Waiter (carries requests and responses)

**Show Them**:
```typescript
// Frontend makes request
const response = await fetch('/api/careers/matches', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ sessionId: '123' })
});

// Backend handles request
router.post('/matches', (req, res) => {
  const { sessionId } = req.body;
  const matches = getMatches(sessionId);
  res.json({ success: true, data: matches });
});
```

### 2. JSON Data Structure
**Analogy**: Digital filing cabinet

**Show Them**:
```json
{
  "id": "29-1141.00",
  "title": "Registered Nurse",
  "sector": "healthcare",
  "description": "Assess patient health...",
  "averageSalary": 75000,
  "educationLevel": "Bachelor's degree"
}
```

### 3. TypeScript Types
**Analogy**: Labels on containers

**Show Them**:
```typescript
// This variable can ONLY hold numbers
let age: number = 16;

// This variable can ONLY hold text
let name: string = "Sarah";

// This object must have these exact properties
interface Career {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  salary: number;
}
```

### 4. React Components
**Analogy**: LEGO blocks for websites

**Show Them**:
```tsx
// A reusable button component
function Button({ text, onClick }) {
  return (
    <button 
      onClick={onClick}
      className="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded"
    >
      {text}
    </button>
  );
}

// Use it anywhere
<Button text="Click Me" onClick={handleClick} />
```

### 5. APIs and HTTP
**Analogy**: Sending letters

**Show Them**:
```
GET /api/careers/123
→ "Please send me career #123"
← { id: "123", title: "Nurse", ... }

POST /api/auth/login
→ "Here's my email and password"
← { success: true, token: "abc123" }
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "npm run dev" fails
**Cause**: Missing dependencies
**Solution**: 
```bash
cd lantern-ai/backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Issue 2: "Port already in use"
**Cause**: Server already running
**Solution**: 
- Find and kill the process
- Or change port in `.env` file

### Issue 3: Changes not showing
**Cause**: Browser cache or server not restarting
**Solution**:
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Restart the server
- Check for syntax errors in console

### Issue 4: TypeScript errors
**Cause**: Type mismatch
**Solution**:
- Read the error message carefully
- Check the type definition
- Add proper type annotations

### Issue 5: API not working
**Cause**: Backend not running or wrong URL
**Solution**:
- Check backend is running on port 3001
- Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in frontend `.env.local`
- Check browser network tab for errors
