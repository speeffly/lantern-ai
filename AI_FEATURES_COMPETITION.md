## 🤖 AI Concepts Implemented

### 1. **Machine Learning-Based Career Matching** 🎯

**What It Is**: An intelligent recommendation system that matches students to careers based on their interests, skills, and preferences.

**How It Works**:
- **Input**: Student responses to 12 assessment questions
- **Processing**: Multi-factor scoring algorithm analyzes:
  - Interest alignment (healthcare vs infrastructure)
  - Skill compatibility
  - Educational background
  - Geographic location
  - Career growth potential
- **Output**: Top 5 career matches with confidence scores (0-100%)

**AI Techniques Used**:
- **Weighted Scoring Algorithm**: Each answer contributes to sector scores
- **Multi-Criteria Decision Making**: Balances multiple factors (salary, demand, education)
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides transparency about match quality

**Files**:
- `backend/src/services/assessmentService.ts` - Scoring logic
- `backend/src/services/recommendationEngine.ts` - Recommendation algorithm

**Example**:
```typescript
// Student answers indicate healthcare interest
answers = [
  { questionId: 1, weight: 5, sector: 'healthcare' },
  { questionId: 2, weight: 4, sector: 'healthcare' }
]

// AI calculates match scores
Registered Nurse: 92% match (high confidence)
Medical Assistant: 87% match (high confidence)
```
