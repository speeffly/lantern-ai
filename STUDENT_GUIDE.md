# Lantern AI - Student Team Guide

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Lantern AI** is a career exploration tool that helps high school students discover careers in healthcare and infrastructure. Think of it like a "career matchmaker" - students answer questions about their interests, and the app recommends careers that fit them.

### What Does It Do?
1. Students take a 12-question quiz about their interests
2. The app matches them with careers (like Registered Nurse, Medical Assistant, etc.)
3. Students can create an account to save their results
4. Each career gets a personalized "action plan" - step-by-step instructions on how to pursue that career

## 🏗️ Project Structure (The Big Picture)

The project has TWO main parts:

### 1. **Backend** (The Brain) 🧠
- Location: `lantern-ai/backend/`
- Language: TypeScript (like JavaScript with extra safety)
- What it does: Stores data, processes quiz answers, calculates career matches
- Runs on: http://localhost:3001

### 2. **Frontend** (The Face) 🎨
- Location: `lantern-ai/frontend/`
- Language: TypeScript + React (for building web pages)
- What it does: Shows the website, handles user interactions
- Runs on: http://localhost:3000

**Think of it like a restaurant:**
- Frontend = The dining room (what customers see)
- Backend = The kitchen (where the cooking happens)

## 🛠️ Key Concepts Explained Simply

### 1. **Frontend vs Backend**
- **Frontend**: What users see and click (like a website)
- **Backend**: The server that stores data and does calculations
- They talk to each other through **APIs** (like sending messages)

### 2. **API (Application Programming Interface)**
Think of it like a restaurant menu:
- Frontend: "I'd like the career matches for session 123"
- Backend: "Here are 5 careers that match!"

Example API call:
```
POST /api/careers/matches
Request: { sessionId: "123", zipCode: "12345" }
Response: { success: true, data: [careers...] }
```

### 3. **TypeScript**
JavaScript with extra safety - it catches mistakes before you run the code.

```typescript
// TypeScript knows this is a number
let age: number = 16;
age = "sixteen"; // ERROR! Can't put text in a number variable
```

### 4. **React Components**
Building blocks for web pages - like LEGO pieces.

```tsx
function WelcomeMessage() {
  return <h1>Welcome to Lantern AI!</h1>;
}
```

### 5. **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**
A way to store data - like a digital filing cabinet.

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "title": "Registered Nurse",
  "salary": 75000,
  "sector": "healthcare"
}
```
