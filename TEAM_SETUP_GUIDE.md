## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Setup (Do This Together)

### Session 1: Install Required Software (45-60 minutes)

#### Step 1: Install Node.js (10 minutes)

**What it is**: JavaScript runtime needed to run the project

**Installation**:
1. Go to https://nodejs.org/
2. Download the **LTS version** (Long Term Support)
3. Run the installer
4. Keep clicking "Next" with default settings
5. Restart computer after installation

**Verify Installation**:
Open Terminal/Command Prompt and type:
```bash
node --version
# Should show: v20.x.x or similar

npm --version
# Should show: 10.x.x or similar
```

---

#### Step 2: Install Git (10 minutes)

**What it is**: Version control system to manage code changes

# Should show: git version 2.x.x
```

**Configure Git** (each student does this):
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

---

#### Step 3: Install VS Code (10 minutes)

**What it is**: Code editor (like Microsoft Word, but for code)

**Each student**:
1. Go to https://github.com/
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Create account with email
4. Verify email address
5. Choose free plan

**Share GitHub usernames** with mentor

---

### Session 2: Set Up the Project (45-60 minutes)

#### Option A: Using GitHub (Recommended for Teams)

This allows students to work independently and merge their changes.

**Mentor Does Once**:

1. **Create GitHub Repository**:
   ```bash
   # In your lantern-ai folder
   cd lantern-ai
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Create repository named "lantern-ai"
   - Follow instructions to push existing repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/lantern-ai.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Add Students as Collaborators**:
   - Go to repository on GitHub
   - Click "Settings" → "Collaborators"
   - Click "Add people"
   - Add each student's GitHub username

**Each Student Does**:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   # Create a folder for projects
   cd Desktop
   mkdir Projects
   cd Projects
   
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/MENTOR-USERNAME/lantern-ai.git
   cd lantern-ai
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Install backend dependencies
   cd backend
   npm install
   
   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create Environment Files**:

   **Backend** - Create `backend/.env`:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   # Windows:
   echo PORT=3001 > .env
   echo FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000 >> .env
   echo JWT_SECRET=lantern-ai-secret-key >> .env
   echo NODE_ENV=development >> .env
   
   # Mac/Linux:
   cat > .env << EOF
   PORT=3001
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
   JWT_SECRET=lantern-ai-secret-key
   NODE_ENV=development
   EOF
   ```

   **Frontend** - Create `frontend/.env.local`:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   # Windows:
   echo NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001 > .env.local
   
   # Mac/Linux:
   echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001" > .env.local
   ```

4. **Test the Setup**:
   
   Open **2 terminals** in VS Code:
   
   **Terminal 1 - Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```
   Should see: "🚀 Lantern AI API running on port 3001"
   
   **Terminal 2 - Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
   Should see: "▲ Next.js ... Local: http://localhost:3000"

5. **Open in Browser**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000
   - You should see the Lantern AI homepage!

---

#### Option B: Using USB Drive (If No Internet/GitHub Access)

**Mentor Does**:
1. Copy entire `lantern-ai` folder to USB drive
2. Give to each student

**Each Student Does**:
1. Copy folder from USB to their computer (e.g., Desktop/Projects/)
2. Follow steps 2-5 from Option A above

## 🔀 Git Workflow for Team Collaboration

### Basic Workflow (Teach This First)

**Before Starting Work**:
```bash
# Get latest changes from team
git pull origin main
```

**After Making Changes**:
```bash
# See what you changed
git status

# Add your changes
git add .

# Save your changes with a message
git commit -m "Added 3 new quiz questions"

# Share your changes with team
git push origin main
```

### Branch Workflow (Recommended for Avoiding Conflicts)

Each student works on their own branch:

**Student 1 (Quiz)**:
```bash
git checkout -b quiz-improvements
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Added new questions"
git push origin quiz-improvements
```

**Student 2 (Careers)**:
```bash
git checkout -b career-data
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Added 5 new careers"
git push origin career-data
```

**Student 3 (Auth)**:
```bash
git checkout -b auth-features
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Improved login page"
git push origin auth-features
```

**Student 4 (Action Plans)**:
```bash
git checkout -b action-plans
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Enhanced action steps"
git push origin action-plans
```

**Merging Changes** (Mentor helps with this):
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge student's work
git merge quiz-improvements

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```
