# ✅ AI Recommendations UI Fix - Complete!

## 🎯 **Issue Identified**

You were seeing "mixed recommendations" because:
1. ✅ **AI recommendations were being generated** (we saw the logs)
2. ❌ **AI recommendations were NOT being displayed** in the UI
3. ❌ **Only counselor recommendations were shown** in the results page

## 🔧 **Solution Applied**

### **Added AI Recommendations Tab**
I've added a new **"🤖 AI Recommendations"** tab to the counselor results page that displays:

#### **1. AI-Generated Career Pathway**
- Step-by-step career progression
- Timeline and requirements
- Personalized for your profile

#### **2. AI-Identified Skill Gaps**
- Skills you need to develop
- Importance level (Critical/Important/Nice-to-have)
- How to acquire each skill

#### **3. AI-Generated Action Items**
- Specific tasks with priorities
- Timelines for completion
- Personalized recommendations

#### **4. AI-Recommended Academic Plan**
- This year's courses
- Next year's courses  
- Long-term academic planning

#### **5. AI-Analyzed Local Job Market**
- Local job opportunities
- Salary information
- Distance from your location

### **Added AI Status Indicator**
The page now shows whether you're getting:
- 🟢 **"AI-Powered Recommendations Included"** (with OpenAI key)
- 🟡 **"Using Fallback Recommendations"** (without OpenAI key)
